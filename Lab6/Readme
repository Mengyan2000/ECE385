System-on-Chip with NIOS II processor
In this lab, we start to use NIOS II processor in assistance with FPGA board and other peripherals such as USB keyboard and monitor. The NIOS II is an IP-based central processing unit (CPU) that can be programmed using higher level languages. It can act as a communicator between the DE-10 Lite board and other devices with the designated IP address in order to generate input and output to the output devices, including FPGA board.
